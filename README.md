## âœ¨ Purpose

This project is a Discord bot mainly intended to be used for the [OKP4 Discord](https://discord.gg/okp4) server. It offers many features that help us keep the server running smoothly while providing many services to our community.

The project also has a wider ambition to provide a general-purpose bot around the [Cosmos ecosystem](https://cosmos.network) that bridges Discord and the blockchains of that ecosystem.
So stay tuned!
